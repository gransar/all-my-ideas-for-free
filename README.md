why am I doing this? 
=====================
This is an experiment in what it means to be open source. Even more
so this is an experiment in what it means to create open
source ideas.

Ideas are stolen, ideas are copied, ideas are recopied, remixed. 
Nothing is new, or is everything new. When we stop protecting our
ideas they have the potential to grow beyond what we orgionally 
manifested. 

There is a traditional tension between an artist idea and how an 
artist uses the internet as a form of freely sharing what they 
create and obtaining recognition. Beyond this, artist work has
lived in an art world which interest lies in limited editions 
and highly sought after artifacts, not ideas which are in the 
public domain.
