all ideas for free dot com
=====================

an experimental website which is constantly updated with all the ideas
I have, or others may add, for art/design/code projects which I have not made, 
all available to use freely

want to share alike with the www? you can tweet your ideas to @whereaddie
or add them yourself via git: all-my-ideas-for-free/index.html


why am I doing this? 
=====================
This is an experiment in what it means to be open source. Even more
so this is an experiment in what it means to create open
source ideas.

Ideas are stolen, ideas are copied, ideas are recopied, remixed. 
Nothing is new, or is everything new. Even when we try to copy we
often unintentionally interpenetrate or personalize. 
Transforming a copy to an iteration .

There is a traditional tension between an artist idea and how an 
artist uses the internet as a form of freely sharing what they 
create, and using social meadia for obtaining recognition. 
Beyond this, artist work has lived in an art world which 
interest lies in limited editions and highly sought after 
artifacts, not ideas which are avilable freely for and in 
the public domain. Ultimately this is about contributing and
distributing to a new contextualization of ideas, art and 
culture through the use of open licenses, open ideas and open art. 


how can I use these ideas?
